# Arched Package Delivery System

Deliver packages to all nodes to earn points
Have to distribute to every node before you can earn point for distributin to the same node again. 

Either countdown timer or first to N points

When a node is delivered to, it becomes unavailbe for deliveres for some time scaled by the trajectory of the package, meaning that it is possible to sabotage the other players slightly.

Nodes can hit themselved to deny delivery, with the added punishment of the package firing mechanism only rechargin after end of stun. 


increasing velocity also increases ground movement speed, but probably not proportionally


##  Game modes:
### blitzround
near zero delay on reload, no targeting help

### sweep mode
angle sweeps from one end of screen to the other, 
player controls height and can hold trigger to either hold in place or double movement

### paint mode
paint the line with your color (could this work?)


# music mode
insert CD, seed is calculated from track data, round time is track length



-- later: 
dark mode - send out flares to see landscape
