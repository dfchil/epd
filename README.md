Deliver packages to all nodes to earn points
Have to distribute to every node before you can earn point for distributin to the same node again. 

Either countdown timer or first to N points

When a node is delivered to, it becomes unavailbe for deliveres for some time scaled by the trajectory of the package, meaning that it is possible to sabotage the other players slightly.

Nodes can hit themselved to deny delivery, with the added punishment of the package firing mechanism only rechargin after end of stun.
